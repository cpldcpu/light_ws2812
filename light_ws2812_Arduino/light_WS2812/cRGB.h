/*
Control a RGB led with Hue, Saturation and Brightness (HSB / HSV )

Hue is change by an analog input.
Brightness is changed by a fading function.
Saturation stays constant at 255

getRGB() function based on <http://www.codeproject.com/miscctrl/CPicker.asp>

/*
dim_curve 'lookup table' to compensate for the nonlinearity of human vision.
Used in the getRGB function on saturation and brightness to make 'dimming' look more natural.
Exponential function used to create values below :
x from 0 - 255 : y = round(pow( 2.0, x+64/40.0) - 1)
