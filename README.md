light_ws2812 V2
============

Light weight library to control WS2811/WS2812/WS2812B based LEDS and LED Strings on 8-Bit AVR and ARM microcontrollers. The new version 2 of this library supports a simplified interface and arbitrary CPU clock.

[See the library in action on a LPC810](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uwxt7SuSV7Y)

Description
===========

This is a small Ansi-C library to control WS2811/WS2812 based RGB Leds and strings. Only the 800kHz
high-speed mode is supported. This library uses a bit-banging approach with cycle optimized assembler
innerloops. Some advantages of this approach compared to other solutions are:

- Compatible to all AVR MCUs since it does not rely on special periphery.
- The code timing is automatically adjusted for CPU clock speeds from 4 Mhz up to the maximum on AVR.
- Much smaller program code: Size optimized assembler without unrolled loops (<50 bytes in most cases)
- Supports standard AVR, reduced core AVR (Attiny 4/5/9/10/20/40) and XMEGA (untested) without special case handling.
- Arduino or C++ not required
- New: Experimental Cortex-M0 ARM core.

The timing values used in the library were adjusted to work on all devices. Look [here](http://cpldcpu.wordpress.com/2014/01/14/light_ws2812-library-v2-0-part-i-understanding-the-ws2812/) and [here](http://cpldcpu.wordpress.com/2014/01/19/light_ws2812-library-v2-0/) for details.

Usage
=====

- Add "light_ws2812.c", "light_ws2812.h" and "ws2812_config.h" to your project. 
- Update "ws2812_config.h" according to your I/O pin.
- Make sure F_CPU is correctly defined in your makefile or the project. (For AtmelStudio: Project->Properties->Toolchain->AVR/GNU C Compiler->Symbols. Add symbol F_CPU=xxxxx)
- Call "ws2812_setleds" with a pointer to the LED array and the number LEDs.
- Alternatively you can use "ws2812_setleds_pin" to control up to 8 LED strips on the same Port.

Examples are provided in the [Examples](https://github.com/cpldcpu/light_ws2812/tree/master/light_ws2812_AVR/Examples) folder. You can build them with the supplied makefile.

Troubleshooting 
================
Please note that incorrect timing is rarely the source of problems. If you want to save some time, go through the items below before altering the library.

None or only a part of the string is lighting up.
* Did you pass the correct array size in the function call?
* Is the pin configuration correct?
* Is anything else connected to the output pin you are using? Some development boards have LEDs connected to various pins.
* Did you choose the correct CPU frequency setting? Did you initialize the clock correctly?

The LEDs are flickering and not showing the intended colour.
* This is usually a problem with insufficient current sourcing capability.
* Are you using a bypass capacitor for each LEDs as indicated in the datasheet? Not using a bypass capacitor will lead to erroneous behaviour. 
* You may have to add an additional electrolytic capacitor at the input of your LED strip if you use long power supply lines.
* Is your power supply able to supply the required current-level? If set to white at maximum brightness, each LED will draw 60mA. A single USB-Port is barely able to supply 10 LEDs.
